AssetManager
============
After writing a desktop application based on QT for managing my assets, thought that the best next step for tracking and managing about any kind of assets is via web.

Using bootstrap, angularjs and codeigniter, AssetManager should end up a beautiful web app to track all of your assets ( any asset that you can think of and put a value to such asset )
============

To include any asset into the manager, a highly customizable approach is needed
It should also allow notes for each assets
It should also allow transactions information for the same asset within a category is the user choses so
============

Disclaimer: This web app is not a replacement for web based personal finance management software like mint, perfios and such others. This is for those who want track their assets and personal finance in a logical manner which suits them.
I am creating this despite having account(s) in such web based personal finance management applications as the way they segregate my finance information is not how I want it
